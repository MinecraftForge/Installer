# Installer
A simple installer for creating Launcher profiles

I modified the installer to add a new UI using WebLAF.

When the user enters the installer, it displays an install button if
they do not have Forge installed.

If they DO have Forge installed, it will display a file drag and drop
pane to add mods.

I also changed the license to the GNU General Public License v3.0.
It is required for WebLAF.
